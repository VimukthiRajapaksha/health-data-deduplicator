# Health Data Deduplication

This repository contains tools and scripts for deduplication of CCDA data converted into FHIR and apply deduplication. The goal is to identify and remove duplicate entries to ensure data consistency and accuracy. The deduplication mechanism is based on AI agent-based approach where the AI agent is communicating with a configured LLM model to identify duplicates based on the given context of the data.
